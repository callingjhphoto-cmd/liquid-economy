# Overnight Build Log — 5 April 2026

## Session summary

**Shipped:** Polish pass — white-on-dark tooltip fix + mobile layout repair (13 files, build clean)

1. **Tooltip text colour — 13 pages fixed.** All recharts `<Tooltip>` components had `itemStyle: { color: '#94a3b8' }` (slate-400, mid-grey) — mismatched against the dark `#1e293b` background. Changed to `#f1f5f9` (slate-100, near-white) across BrandPricing, BrandHealth, CategoryIntelligence, ClimateYield, Companies, DepletionForecasting, Financials, MarginCalculator, MarketEntryWizard, ScenarioModeling, SupplyChain, Valuations, VenueIntelligence. 29 instances corrected in one pass.

2. **Companies 5-year chart axis labels — invisible tick fix.** XAxis and YAxis tick elements were missing `fill: '#9ca3af'`; in most browsers this left tick labels invisible against the white chart background. Added fill colour and explicit YAxis width (45px).

3. **SupplyChain expanded commodity panel — mobile layout.** The chart + metadata side-by-side `flex` row would squeeze to unusable width at 375 px. Changed to `flex-col sm:flex-row` so it stacks vertically on mobile and goes side-by-side at ≥640 px.

4. **Data quality audits — confirmed clean.** CategoryIntelligence: all 11 categories × 5 years have complete marketSize, growth, channels, brands, volumeCases data. VenueIntelligence: all 28 London profiles have required fields. BrandPricing: 272 expressions across 13 categories — counts, channel sums, and market coverage are consistent.

5. **Build:** `vite build` ✓ — 2443 modules, 0 errors, 0 warnings. Pushed to main; Railway auto-deploy triggered.
